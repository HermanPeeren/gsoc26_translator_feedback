/**
 * Assembles the installable archives from src/.
 *
 * There are two of them, and they are released as two downloads:
 *
 *   php build/build.php          the package: the component and the five plugins that
 *                                make up the translation pipeline
 *   php build/build.php seed     plg_task_translationsseed on its own
 *
 * The seed plugin is not in the package because it is not part of the pipeline: it reads
 * an installed language pack once to give a site something to learn from, and a site that
 * does not want that should not have it installed.
 *
 * What goes into the package is read from pkg_translations.xml rather than listed here, so
 * adding an extension to the package is one line in the manifest. The version comes from
 * the manifest too, which is the single place each one is written: the archive is named
 * after it, and the release workflow refuses to publish a tag that disagrees with it.
 *
 * Entry names always use forward slashes, and each archive carries its manifest at its
 * root - a wrapper folder or a backslash separator both break the install on a Linux host.
