/**
 * Test bootstrap.
 *
 * The suite covers this package's own logic, so it loads the package's classes and
 * nothing else: there is no Joomla installation here, and no attempt to imitate one.
 * What the classes need from the framework comes from the framework packages the CMS
 * itself ships (joomla/registry, joomla/event); what they need from the CMS is
 * declared in tests/Stub/joomla.php, which exists only so a class can be loaded.
 *
 * Whether this package still fits the CMS it is installed into is a question about
 * signatures rather than behaviour, and PHPStan answers it: phpstan.neon scans a real
 * Joomla in joomla/.
 *
 * @package     Joomla.Tests
 * @subpackage  com_translations
